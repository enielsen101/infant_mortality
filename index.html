	<p> 
		Black infants were roughly three times more likely to die than white infants in New York City in 2020, the last year data was available, according to NYC Open Data. (An infant, as opposed to a neonate or a postneonate, is <a href="https://www.health.gov.za/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/AgeDefinitions2012.pdf">defined</a> as a baby more than 28 days and less than one year old.) Similar but smaller disparities separate Puerto Rican, Hispanic and Asian infant mortality rates from the white infant mortality rate. 
	</p>

	<p>
		Those numbers remain stubbornly relevant. In 2023, for example, the infant mortality rate rose across the U.S. by 3%, the <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/health/last-years-u-s-infant-mortality-rate-hit-its-highest-increase-in-two-decades"> largest increase</a> seen in two decades. According to Rodneyse Bichotte Hermelyn, Assemblymember for the 42nd District in Brooklyn, there is an <a href="https://spectrumlocalnews.com/nys/central-ny/politics/2024/10/15/pregnancy-infant-loss-awareness-month">infant mortality crisis</a> in New York City that affects the Black population in particular. It is a subject Bichotte Hermelyn knows well – in 2016 her infant son Jonah died after she was turned away from a hospital because of insurance policy complications. And in 2022 Mayor Eric Adams introduced <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/office-of-the-mayor/news/149-22/mayor-adams-takes-action-reduce-maternal-infant-health-inequities-expanding-access-to#/0">initiatives</a> he said were attempts to remedy racial disparities in infant and maternal health.
	</p>

	<p>
		Infant mortality rates did decrease for all racial demographics in the city from 2010 to 2020. During that time, for example, the infant mortality rate for Black infants decreased from roughly 10% to 7%. But during the same years that number remained more than three times what it was for white infants. That is, in 2020, seven out of every 1,000 Black infants died; in the same year only two out of every 1,000 white infants died. 
	</p>

	<p>
		Benjamin Sosnaud, a professor of sociology and anthropology at Trinity University who studies infant mortality, said that while progress is being made, the causes for these continued racial disparities are structural. 
	</p>

	<p>
		“Part of the problem is that a lot of the factors that are producing the inequalities are fairly entrenched,” he said in an interview, “and unfortunately a lot of the benefits we’re achieving are not necessarily being distributed to everybody.”
	</p>
	
	<p>
		The factors Sosnaud pointed to can have negative consequences for the mother and her baby’s health even before birth. Those factors include higher exposure to hazardous environmental pollutants, access to unprocessed food, socio-economic poverty and chronic stress, including the chronic stress of racial discrimination and inequality.
	</p>

	<p>
		Income data supports Sosnaud’s claim that inequality contributes to racial disparities in infant mortality rates. According to the New York Department of Health, for example, the  <a href="https://www.health.ny.gov/statistics/community/minority/county/newyorkcity.htm"> median income</a> for white households in New York City from 2018-2022 was $110,000, whereas for Black households during the same period that number was $58,000. 
	</p>

	<p>
		Sosnaud also stressed the importance of new interventions for saving infants’ lives. Advances in medical technology, he said, save very young and at-risk babies. 

	</p>

	<p>
		“But any time you have interventions that are effective,” Sosnaud said, “it highlights the importance of making sure everyone has access to those interventions.”
